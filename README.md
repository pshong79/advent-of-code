# advent-of-code
These are my solutions. I am currently working my way through the current year (2023) and as I learn more and gain more confidence, I am going back and attempting to solve past years' problems.

My goal is not to write the `cleanest` or the `most efficient` code; rather, it is to be able to break down the larger problem to smaller, more basic problems and come up with a working solution, and in the process, hopefully gain a better knowledge of Ruby and to, ultimately, become a better developer.

At some point in the future, I will go back and attempt to refactor my solutions.

## Solutions
To execute the solutions for each problem, you must `cd` into the directory before running the command:
```
$ ruby <filename>.rb
```

If you are not in the current directory, you must update the path of the `input.txt` file for that problem in the `<filename>.rb` file.
